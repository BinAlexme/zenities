Thank you so much for visiting my Hyprland rice. I'm relatively new to ricing, and while it's no where near perfect, I've put a lot of care into it. This rice is inspired by so many awesome people's work, though I regret I can't list everyone by name

I hope you enjoy it, and feel free to use this rice!
